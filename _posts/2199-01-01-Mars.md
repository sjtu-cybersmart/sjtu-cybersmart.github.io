# Mars Plan
## Introduction
Mars plan is launched by CyberSmart members for the next generation of Cyber Vehicle.

## Developer's Guide
- [developing guide](https://sjtu-cybersmart.github.io/wiki/Guide/developing-guide/)
- Edition of tiggo_msgs is owned by Mars Planning Committee. All developers share with the same version of tiggo_msgs.
- ROS messages should be used only when pub-sub or services are required. In another word, if a data structure is only used in one node, you can either create a class for it or used data structures provided by Opencv, PCL, Eigen and so on.
- Try to use standard msgs provided by ROS to fix communication requirements. Msgs outside of tiggo_msgs should be defined in certain packages without creating another tiggo_msgs package.
